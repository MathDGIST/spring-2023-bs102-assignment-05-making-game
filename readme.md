# Assignment 5: Making a game

In this assignment, we will make a game using *ebiten* package.

* Ebiten homepage <https://ebitengine.org/>
* Documentation for ebiten <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2>

**You should make a game that involves a differential equation for modeling the game**. For example, you can make a game that

* contains a story on a situation that you can model it with a differential equation;
* you can model its strategy with a differential equation;
* requires a differential equation to create certain game environment.

In the folder `/2d-spring` and `/a-white-dot`, I wrote examples codes for simple games. 

* `2d-spring` draws a spring that connects the points of two previous mouse click.
* `a-white-dot` is a game that a player should move the circle to the white dot.

Write the contents of `main.go` to make your own game!
